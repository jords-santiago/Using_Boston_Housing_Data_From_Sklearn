# Using Boston Housing Data From Sklearn
This simple project checks out the Boston Housing Data from scikit-learn.  Scikit-learn has a lot of datasets available in sklearn.datasets to developers to try out.

This project uses matplotlib and scikit-learn to plot the features of this dataset as well as use models to predict the target value.
